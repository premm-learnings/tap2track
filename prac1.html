        <p>An expense management system streamlines the process of tracking, submitting, approving, and reimbursing employee expenses within an organization. Employees submit expense reports through a web or mobile application, often accompanied by digital receipts. The system routes these reports to managers for approval, ensuring they comply with company policies. Approved expenses are then processed by the finance team for reimbursement, with all transactions recorded and integrated into the company's accounting software. This automated process enhances efficiency, reduces errors, and provides real-time insights into spending patterns, aiding in better financial oversight and cost control.</p>
